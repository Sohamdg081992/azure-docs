Create your [API center](../overview.md) to start an inventory of your organization's APIs. Azure API Center enables tracking APIs in a centralized location for discovery, reuse, and governance.

After creating your API center, follow the steps in the tutorials to add custom metadata, APIs, versions, definitions, and other information.

## Prerequisites

* If you don't have an Azure subscription, create an [Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

* At least a Contributor role assignment or equivalent permissions in the Azure subscription.
