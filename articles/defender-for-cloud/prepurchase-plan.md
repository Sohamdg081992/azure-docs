# Optimize Microsoft Defender for Cloud costs with a prepurchase plan

You can save on your Microsoft Defender for Cloud costs when you prepurchase Microsoft Defender for Cloud commit units (DCU) for one year. You can use the prepurchased DCUs at any time during the purchase term. Unlike VMs, the prepurchased units don't expire on an hourly basis and you can use them at any time during the term of the purchase.

Any eligible Microsoft Defender for Cloud usage deducts from the prepurchased DCUs automatically. You don't need to redeploy or assign a prepurchased plan to your Microsoft Defender for Cloud workspaces for the DCU usage to get the prepurchase discounts.

## Determine the right size to buy

A Defender for Cloud prepurchase applies to all Defender for Cloud plans. You can think of the prepurchase as a pool of prepaid Defender for Cloud commit units. Usage is deducted from the pool, regardless of the workload.

Thereâ€™s no ratio on which the DCUs are applied. DCUs are equivalent to the purchase currency value and are deducted at retail prices. Like other reservations, the benefit of a prepurchase plan is discounted pricing by committing to a purchase term. The more you buy, the larger the discount you receive.

For example, if you purchase 5,000 Commit Units for a one year term, you get a 20% discount on Defender for Cloud products at this tier, so you pay only 4,000 USD. You can use these units with Defender for Servers P2 and Defender CSPM plans on 20 Virtual machines (Azure VMs) for one year, which uses up 4800 Commit units. In this example, we use $15/$5 monthly retail price and 1 DCU = $1.

> The mentioned prices are for example purposes only. They aren't intended to represent actual costs.

The Microsoft Defender for Cloud prepurchase discount applies to usage from the following products:

- Microsoft Defender for Servers
- Microsoft Defender for App Service
- Microsoft Defender for Storage
- Microsoft Defender for Key Vault
- Microsoft Defender for SQL
- Microsoft Defender for DNS
- Microsoft Defender for Resource Manager
- Microsoft Defender for PostgreSQL
- Microsoft Defender for MariaDB
- Microsoft Defender for Azure Cosmos DB
- Microsoft Defender for Containers
- Microsoft Defender CSPM
- Microsoft Defender for APIs

## Purchase Defender for Cloud commit units

You can buy Defender for Cloud plans in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). To buy a prepurchase plan, you must have the owner role for at least one enterprise or Microsoft Customer Agreement or an individual subscription with pay-as-you-go rates subscription, or the required role for CSP subscriptions.

- To buy a reservation, you must have owner role or reservation purchaser role on an Azure subscription.

- For Enterprise Agreement (EA) subscriptions, the **Reserved Instances** policy option must be enabled in the [Azure portal](/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/direct-ea-administration#view-and-manage-enrollment-policies). Or if that setting is disabled, you must be an EA Admin of the subscription.

- For CSP subscriptions, follow the steps in [Acquire, provision, and manage Azure reserved VM instances (RI) + server subscriptions for customers](/partner-center/azure-ri-server-subscriptions).

**To Purchase:**

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. If needed, navigate to **Reservations** and then at the top of the page, select **+ Add**.
1. On the Purchase reservations page, select **Microsoft Defender for Cloud Pre-Purchase Plan**.
1. On the Select the product you want to purchase page, select a subscription. Use the **Subscription** list to select the subscription used to pay for the reserved capacity. The payment method of the subscription is charged the upfront costs for the reserved capacity.
